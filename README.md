# Rezzy

Demonstrates a simple application with Elixir, including important concepts of the language.
Check out the `ecto` branch for Ecto integration.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `rezzy` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:rezzy, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `rezzy` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:rezzy]]
    end
    ```
